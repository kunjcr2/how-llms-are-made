# 🧠 Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models

## 📄 What is Multi-Token Prediction?
Traditionally, language models like GPT predict **one token at a time** — generating the next word or subword based on everything before it.  
Meta’s 2024 paper proposes a **multi-token prediction** approach, where the model tries to predict **several upcoming tokens simultaneously** during training.

## ✅ Why Use Multi-Token Prediction?

Meta found that predicting multiple tokens at once gives the model **stronger supervision** and **better understanding of context**. Here's why it helps:

## 🔍 Key Advantages

### 1. **Denser Learning Signals**
- Instead of training on just 1 next-token prediction per input, the model gets **several supervised predictions** (one per future token).
- This leads to **more gradient updates** and faster learning.

### 2. **Wider Context Awareness**
- When predicting multiple tokens, the model implicitly learns about **future structure**, grammar, and flow.
- Helps the model understand **“what comes next” not just “what comes immediately after”**.

### 3. **Improved Representations**
- Predicting multiple future tokens encourages the model to build **stronger internal representations**.
- This results in better **semantic awareness** and **contextual reasoning**.

### 4. **Lower Training Loss**
- Because more targets are predicted per training step, the model converges to lower loss values faster.
- More efficient training overall.

### 5. **No Inference Change Required**
- The technique is used **only during training**.
- At inference time, the model still predicts one token at a time — keeping things compatible with standard decoding methods.

## 🧪 Technical Insight
- Multi-token prediction works by **adding multiple future tokens** to the loss function.
- Instead of just computing the loss for token `t+1`, the model computes it for `t+1`, `t+2`, `t+3`, etc.
- These predictions can be **weighted** or **scored** differently based on repetition or confidence.

## 📈 Real-World Results
- Meta showed that this technique led to **significant improvements** in downstream tasks and benchmark accuracy (e.g., perplexity and next-word prediction).
- It can be applied to both small and large language models.

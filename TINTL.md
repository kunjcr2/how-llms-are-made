> ### Structure -> (What, Why not, From where)

1. Reinforcement learning - TOO complex - Vizuara AI
2. RLHF vs DPO - Reinforcement Learning - Youtube, GPT
3. New minor tasks like gradient checkpointing, Mixed precision, kernal fusion; etc - TOO Little or TOO MUCH of information, making it hard to learn.
4. Vision transformers - I need to learn about Text-to-text first - Youtube is BEST for this

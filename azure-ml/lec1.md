# What is Azure Machine Learning ?

**its complex and it has a lot**

- With workspace like our laptop, they are connected with dependencies like Blob storage, Compute targets, a lot of azure services like azure storage account, container registery as well as there are compute instance and compute clusters. (pay as you go).
- there are bunch of assets. we create a MODEL, do inderence with ENDPOINTS, by calling PIPELINES where model was trained on DATASETS. we EXPERIMENT the model in the ENVIRONMENT of model itself that we create. (These bold people are called assets of the AzureML)

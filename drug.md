## Meeting Notes – Medicine & Side Effects Project

### Problem Understanding

- Medicines often have significant side effects.
- Goal: Help normal users **avoid harmful medicines** if they have certain conditions.
- Balance needed between:

  - **Not scaring users** unnecessarily.
  - Providing **detailed and accurate information**.

- Challenge: **Getting data** is hard (issue exists in the US too).
- Diagnosis via app is **not conclusive** → must rely on **self-reported symptoms**.

### Key Considerations

- **Data issues**:

  - Hard to source clean medical data.
  - Kaggle and government datasets available (see below).
  - Professor’s mentor may provide additional datasets.

- **Ethics & Privacy**:

  - Self-reported health data needs strong protection.
  - Users are concerned about privacy when entering health info.
  - Data security must be a top priority.

- **Monetization**:

  - Potential for chronic illness markets.
  - Careful execution needed to avoid hiccups.

- **Expert Involvement**:

  - Talk to **pharmacy students** (e.g., Preksha) for practical insights.
  - Involve **law experts** (law schools often provide free advice).
  - Need **criteria/thresholds** for when the app gives a warning or recommendation.

- **Education**:

  - Team needs to gain basic medical & pharmaceutical knowledge.

### Next Steps

1. Define **clear project goals** (symptoms → medicine → side effects).
2. Finalize approach for **symptom reporting & side effect tracking**.
3. Explore datasets (professor will follow up after contacting mentor).
4. Research **ethical and legal frameworks** for handling medical data.
5. Consult **pharmacy students** for domain expertise.
6. Engage with **law school/free legal advice** for compliance.
7. Build knowledge in **medical and drug-related basics**.
